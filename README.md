This comprehensive service dashboard that captures crucial KPI metrics and transforms them into visually engaging representations. Here's a sneak peek into what the dashboard entails:
📊 Panel 1: Visualizing Recalls per Car Model
In the top left area, I've designed a captivating column chart that showcases the number of recalls per car model. This chart enables a quick comparison of recall occurrences across different models, providing essential insights for effective decision-making.
🌍 Panel 2: Analyzing Customer Sentiment
Located in the top right area, I've employed a treemap to depict customer sentiment. By comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews, this visualization offers a holistic view of customer perceptions. Understanding sentiment trends empowers organizations to make informed adjustments and enhance customer satisfaction.
📈📉 Panel 3: Monitoring Sales and Profit
The bottom left area houses a dynamic line and column chart. This visualization tracks the quantity of cars sold per month alongside the corresponding profit. By correlating these two critical factors, businesses can uncover valuable patterns, identify sales opportunities, and optimize profitability.
🔥 Panel 4: Unveiling Recalls by Model and Affected System
To gain a deeper understanding of potential outliers, I've integrated a powerful heat map in the bottom right area. This heat map reveals the number of recalls based on the car model and affected system. This analysis helps pinpoint specific models or systems that require attention, enabling proactive measures to address any anomalies.
With this comprehensive service dashboard, organizations can leverage actionable insights to streamline processes, enhance customer experience, and drive business growth. 📈💼
